It aims to maximize opportunities for a significant increase in hydrocarbon production, supplying them to the domestic market, production of high value-added products, oil and gas processing, export of technological products, export and marketing. - create favorable conditions for attracting foreign direct investment in the gas industry.</p><p>The country has passed laws on subsoil, on production sharing agreements and the president’s initiative to “attract foreign direct investment in the exploration and production of oil and gas”. In the first years of activity of Uzbekneftegaz, Kokdumalakskoye, Alanskoye, Urginskoye, Yuzhny Tandyrchskoye and other fields developed rapidly and were ready for development.</p><p> Intensification of exploration is a key factor in creating a reliable resource base that will last for many years. The main goal is to increase the industrial reserves of hydrocarbons beyond their production. For this, the company began to use new methods and advanced technologies in the exploration of oil and gas fields. The work carried out in those years confirmed that the Bukhara-Khiva and Surkhandarya regions of the country have great prospects in this regard. In particular, rich reserves were discovered on Ustyurt, and large deposits of natural gas, such as Surgil, East Berdakh and Uchsai, were discovered on its territory.</p><p>Another opposite direction of industry development is the production of synthetic oil from oil shale based on high-speed pyrolysis technology. Uzbekneftegaz plans to implement 54 investment projects in 2015-2019. Therefore, the country pays special attention to attracting foreign investors. The most important investment projects are implemented in cooperation with Gazprom and Lukoil (Russia), CNODC (China), Petrovietnam (Vietnam), KNOC (Korea), SASOL (South Africa), the Aral Sea Project Consortium and other companies .</p><p>— The launch of a number of open oil and gas fields in the activities of oil and gas companies, as well as the extraction of unconventional and complex reserves is of paramount importance. requires the selection of appropriate technological tools.</p>",
